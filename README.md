<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Balls.</h1>
 
<strong>Interaction</strong>: Well, it's a slightly less interactive project than others are doing. It's meant to use the accelerometer on a phone, but I just need to do a lot of finessing. The base of the game is actually pretty solid, I'm happy with it, but it could look so much better in all honesty. I just want to make it look better.

<strong>Description</strong>: You're a ball. A bunch of balls are trying to kill you. Get away from the other balls. It's a simply concept, but I think it could go a long way.
